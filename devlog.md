The `in_bounds/3` predicate checks whether a supplied row and column index points to a valid place inside the maze. It first confirms that each coordinate is zero or larger. Next it tests that the row index is below the total row count. It also checks that the column index is below the column count of every row - any move stays inside the maze.
