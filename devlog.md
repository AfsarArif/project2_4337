This section explains how the program reaches a single cell in the maze and finds the start square. The first rule of `cell_at/4` stops the search at once if it meets a temporary `'n'` value - this guards against errors that appear when the map is created at random. The main `cell_at/4` rule fetches the contents of a given row and column through `nth0/3`; `start_position/3` calls the same rule and returns the only square that holds the letter `'s'`.
