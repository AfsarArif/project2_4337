The predicate `valid_maze/1` checks that a maze has correct form before the program tries to solve it. First it confirms that the maze is a non empty list of rows and that every row is a list. Next it checks that all rows have equal length - the maze forms a rectangle. It also checks that the maze contains one start cell and at least one exit cell. The helper predicate `same_length/2` verifies that every row contains the same number of columns.
