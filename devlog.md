The `follow_actions/6` predicate simulates moving through the maze according to a list of actions. The base case states that if the action list is empty, the current position is already the final position, so the starting and ending coordinates are the same. In the recursive case, the predicate applies the first action using `step/6` to calculate a new position, then continues processing the remaining actions to determine the final row and column reached.
