The `step/6` predicate works out the outcome of one move from a given maze square. It first asks `delta/3` how far the row and the column must shift. It adds those numbers to the old row plus column to obtain the new square and it verifies that the new square lies inside the maze. It then confirms that the destination square is not a wall - only floor squares, the start square or the exit square are accepted.
