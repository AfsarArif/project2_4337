The find_exit/1 and find_exit/2 predicates handle the core maze solving task. The single argument form, find_exit(Maze), merely calls find_exit/2 while leaving the second argument unbound letting Prolog return a working list of moves. The two argument form, find_exit(Maze, Actions), does the real work - it first confirms that the maze is well formed with valid_maze/1, which checks that the structure is correct, that it holds exactly one start and that it contains at least one exit. Next it retrieves the start coordinates through start_position/3. It then walks through the supplied Actions list with follow_actions/6, which yields the final row plus column after every move. Finally it verifies that the reached cell is an exit - using cell_at/4. The predicate succeeds only when the moves lead from the start to an exit - otherwise it fails.
