Maze Solver - Prolog Project 
CS Project - find_exit/2 Maze Navigation 

The project delivers a Prolog program that checks a maze and shows a way out. The maze appears as a list that contains further lists. The main task is to create the predicate find_exit/2. This predicate tests whether a given list of moves takes the agent from the start square to an exit square. If the move list remains a variable, the program produces a correct list of moves on its own.
